The Pearson correlation coefficient (named for Karl Pearson) can be used to summarize the strength of the linear relationship between two data samples.

The Pearsonâ€™s correlation coefficient is calculated as the covariance of the two variables divided by the product of the standard deviation of each data sample. It is the normalization of the covariance between the two variables to give an interpretable score.

Pearson's correlation coefficient = covariance(X, Y) / (stdv(X) * stdv(Y))

The use of mean and standard deviation in the calculation suggests the need for the two data samples to have a Gaussian or Gaussian-like distribution.

We discuss here the possibility of using Pearson correlation coefficients integrated into a finite rationality hypothesis model to classify user characteristics as a means of filtering out the factors that influence differences in user needs and behaviors to be used as a basis for user classification.
